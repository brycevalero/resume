					<p>My career started out in the United States Air Force as a fireman.
						I completed 6 years of active duty and decided to join the Air National Guard so I could go to college full time and attain my Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>
					<p>Now, I am a versatile developer with almost 10 years of experience developing embedded software to websites. 
						I Have a keen eye with a knack for creating friendly interfaces, and the ability to manage multiple projects while ensuring timely completion of project deadlines within budget.</p>
					<p>I get a very large amount of personal satisfaction when I can create something from scratch that is easy for others to use.  
						I believe that no matter how complicated a piece of software is under the hood, it can be designed in a way that is intuitive.
						I understand that most clients want the most functionality possible, but there needs to be a balance.  
						End Users should have the functionality available when they need it, but the ease of use when they do not, plain and simple.</p>
