					<p>Hi, Im Bryce. Most likely you have either stumbled upon this site by accident, or I gave you the link to look at as a resume for my potential employment. Either way, This site is mainly just a collection of randomn things that I have worked on. Some things may not even make sense, but its nice to have a place to dump all my projects, finished or not.</p>

					<p>Be sure to check back if you like the site, as I am going to be adding a ton of stuff in the near future. Basically, everything that I have done in the last 4 years will be here for everyone to see.</p>
