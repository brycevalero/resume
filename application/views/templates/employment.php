							<div class="fh5co-accordion-body">
								<p>Developed Lexmark vending application with open services gateway initiative (OSGI) framework. 
									The application communicates with vending hardware via USB using Jamex’s proprietary protocol JPC. 
									The Lexmark embedded application is a completely ‘off-the-glass’ touchscreen solution for copy, print, scan and fax vending. 
									Everything is written in Java using Lexmark’s embedded services framework (eSF) software development kit. 
									Lexmark recently upgraded to a new android operating system, so I was in the process of building an android version of the application. </p>
			
								<p>Completed Jamex copy card revalue station application bundled with credit card payment. 
									The project was a C++ Qt project which runs on an embedded Debian operating system. 
									The machine takes a credit card or cash and then dispenses a card with a value on it. </p>
			
								<p>Designed and built a Jamex protocol development tool that emulated a payment device. 
									JPC devices are Jamex payment devices that implement the JPC protocol over serial port communication. 
									The emulator was a C++ Qt emulator that could be compiled for practically any OS. 
									My code base has grown since its creation by other developer contributions.</p>
			
								<p>Developed Jamex’s website. Reduced overall cost, as opposed to outsourcing development to another company. 
									The site has dealer support section hidden by registration.</p>

								<p>Designed and Developed various websites as a subcontractor for Photonic enterprises. 
									Most websites were Drupal sites that needed to be set up and themed using jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3. 
									Few needed any custom PHP modules created. 
									Most were government sites or ecommerce sites that required a payment gateway incorporated.</p>
			
								<p>Developed functionality for a single webpage truck tracking application designed by Reddog Logistics. 
									This site was a very AJAX heavy site that could track a fleet of trucks real-time. 
									There was a control center where an administrator could track the trucks, while each truck had its own slave application that communicated with several sensors installed on the truck.</p>
